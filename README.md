wpa3 establishment great with the new script. now we're dealing with mt76 overcurrent bug issues.

it seems there is an issue post kernel 5.15 with these mt76 cards and extended use.
I'm seeing "overcurrent failures in the 400-600 second mark. no idea why this is coming up now 
I thought maybe it was the 6.12 kernel, but rolling back to 6.6 didnt help
then i looked at my Pi->card cabling thinking maybe that was the issue
tried multiple versions, even tried the one that came with the card. No good.

See below for notes
