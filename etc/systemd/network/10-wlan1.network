# NOTE: This file is NOT used on the system
# The actual file at /etc/systemd/network/10-wlan1.network.disabled
# has been disabled because systemd-networkd conflicts with the
# manual mesh interface configuration in mesh-start.sh
#
# The IP address (MESH_IP) is now applied manually in mesh-start.sh
# using: ip addr add $MESH_IP/24 dev wlan1

# Original configuration (for reference only):
